        Renzo Rosso created the Diesel brand in 1978, choosing the name because it is easy to understand,
        pronounced the same way around the world, and has a rugged feel about it; at that time, Diesel was
        also considered an alternative energy so it was representative of an alternative taste in casual wear.
        In 1985 Renzo Rosso acquired sole control of Diesel and surrounded himself with an international team of
        talented designers and staff. Diesel launched its first For Successful Living advertising campaign in 1991,
        instantly establishing a reputation for innovative marketing. The brands first flagship stores, in New York,
        Rome and London, opened in 1996.
